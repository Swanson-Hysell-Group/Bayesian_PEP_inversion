Irving et al. (1974) studied the magnetization of the Morin Anorthosite in detail and noted that the high coercivity characteristic remanence was carried by ilmenite with exsolved hematite. Following the discussion of the microcline gneiss samples presented here, the acquisition temper- ature for the Morin samples was probably similar, less than 520 _ C. Detailed cooling curves do not exist for the Morin terrain, and the best estimate for peak metamorphism is 30ï¿½90 my earlier than in the Adirondacks (Peck and Valley, 2000) requiring the magnetiza- tion to be older than 960 Ma.
