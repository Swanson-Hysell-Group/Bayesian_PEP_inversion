http://earthref.org/MAGIC/books/Tauxe/2005/lecture.09.htm#LT-AFZ	LT-AF-Z	Alternating field: In zero field	A specimen is subject to a decaying and alternating magnetic field such that the magnetic moments with coercivities below the peak field are aligned in opposed directions, and thus cancel. Specimens are typically reoriented in three or more orthogonal axes.	Lab Treatment	A
